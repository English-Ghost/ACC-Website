    <p>I went to highschool in Katy, Texas at Seven Lakes Highschool. The most notable classes that I took while at Seven Lakes were the digital arts classes and the Computer Science class I took. I took digital arts all 4 years I was in highschool.
      I started out using Photoshop and Illustrator learning the basics, and then I moved into the realm of video editing and special effects by using Premiere and After Effects. While also in my sophmore year I decided to take a Ap Computer Science
      class which is where I started to get interested in coding. We learnt the basics of Java and also learned just a little bit of GUI in that class. Once in junior year I started doing the tv program that the school had on Fridays for all the
      students, this is where my digital affects skills came in handy and I was able to start putting them towards use. I learnt a lot of things about project management and working together or projects within that class. The summer between junior
      and senior year was where I started learning Python with a friend and that solidified my choice of major in college at that point. In senior year was when I started learning how to do 3D design by using 3DS Max in my Advanced Digital Arts class
      Other noticible things that happened to me with in highschool was that I was nominated for both the homecoming court during my senior year and for Mr. Congeniality. I was also part of the Young Film Makers club at Seven Lakes where we made a couple short films one that did pretty well in a contest amoung others.

    <h2 class="w3-text-light-grey">College</h2>
    <hr style="width:200px" class="w3-opacity">
    <p>In college I got more experience with coding and programing whilist also getting more use of digital design software. I am on track to graduate a semester late, but I have been taking some classes that are more intresting to me than others that would
      allow me to graduate faster. So far college has been enhancing my experience to learn more of what I want and when I want. In the beginning of college I was a Blinn Academy student which put me at half time at Blinn Community College and half time at
      Texas A&M. It allowed me to take college at a slower pace since I am a first generation college student and get my bearing to how college actually works. Whilst in college I have joined multiple clubs, one being Texas A&M Coding Society which is the
      SEC sactioned Computer Science club and the other being Tamusic which is a music club at A&M which gathers students from every major together to learn more about music.
