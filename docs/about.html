    <h2 class="w3-text-light-grey">Early Years</h2>
    <hr style="width:200px" class="w3-opacity">
    <p>I was born in Poole, England in 1999 and lived there up until I was 5-6 years old, and my family has been back almost once a year since. We moved away from England to Houston, Texas where I have been ever
      since. I attended elementary school, middle school, and highschool in Texas and I'm currently completeing my education at Texas A&M. I've only lived in in Poole, England and Houston, Texas. in 2014 I got my
      American citizenship, However I kept my English citizenship as well allowing me to become a dual citizen. In highschool I taught myself some coding and how to do 3D modeling, which made me make my final decision
      on which major I wanted to take up and where.

    <h2 class="w3-text-light-grey">College Years</h2>
    <hr style="width:200px" class="w3-opacity">
    <p>On my way to get a better education I chose Texas A&M for my college and decided to take up a major in Computer Science and get a minor in New Media Art. I am currently in my third year at Texas A&M and only switched
      my major once from Electrical Engineering to Computer Science. I only recently started my minor in New Media Art, which is dedicated towards digital graphics and 3D design. I'm hoping that I finish college by 2021, which
      would put me at graduating in 4 or 4 and a half years.

    <h2 class="w3-text-light-grey">What I Want To Do For Work</h2>
    <hr style="width:200px" class="w3-opacity">
    <p>When I was young I always had an idea that I would do something with the entertainment industry, which is one of the feilds that I want to get into. I'm hoping that I might be able to get a internship at a
      game developer company and either work the front end or back end. I'd rather do the front end since I'm more inclinded to do UI/UX than the back end. The minor should also help me get a foot in the door for any
      company that is looking to hire on that end.
