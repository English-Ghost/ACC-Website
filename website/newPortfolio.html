    <h2 class="w3-text-light-grey">Programing Languages</h2>
    <hr style="width:200px" class="w3-opacity">
    <p>For the programing languages I have had a use for at least every language that was stated. In CSCE 121, 221, and 222 we used C++, which set that as one of the main languages I use. Python I used at my internship
      where I had to translate FORTRAN code, this is also my experience in FORTRAN, into Python. For Java I had use of it in highschool in my AP Computer Science class and got a 4 on the AP exam, But also I had use
      of it in CSCE 314 where we had multiple programs in the language and one final project where we had to write a GUI using Java and also create the backend of the project using Java. SCHEME was also of some use
      in CSCE 314 where for the first half of the semester we learnt how to use SCHEME. GIT is where I store all my work, I got used to using it in my first semester of junior year and now I use it for all of my projects
      whether they are private or public.

    <h2 class="w3-text-light-grey">Art Skills</h2>
    <hr style="width:200px" class="w3-opacity">
    <p>Most of my work is made in the 3D space using programs like Maya, 3DS Max, and Mudbox. I have recently started using Blender for a way to animate my 3D designs, but not enough to really have much experience
      within the program. My traditional art skills are about average compared to everyone, hence why I work more in the 3D space where items are easier to control and get the look that is wanted. I have use in Photoshop,
      Illustrator, Premiere, and After Effects. Each one of those programs was used multiple times over the course of my highschool experience, first was Photoshop and Illustrator in Digital design class during my freshman
      year. Premiere and After Effects was used in a video and animation class during my sophmore year in highschool. They were also used again when I worked on the school wide TV program we made in Junior year. And all of
      the programs mentioned, even Maya and 3DS Max, were used in my senior year of highschool in my advanced digital arts class.

    <h2 class="w3-text-light-grey">Internships</h2>
    <hr style="width:200px" class="w3-opacity">
    <p>So far I have had one internship during my freshman to sophmore year at BD Energy Systems. During this internship I was given a FORTRAN code and had the task of rewriting the FORTRAN code into Python code with a GUI
      so that the engineers would have easier access to the programs. The GUI was made using TKinter since nothing fancy was needed for the engineers to understand how the program worked. In total there were about 6 programs
      we recreated in this style and once we had gotten it almost finshed we would have an engineer test it. In order for that to happen we would let the engineer do the equations by hand and then once through the program
      and compare the answers. To much detail about the program can't be given since it was created to be sold. BD Energy Systems: <a href="http://www.bdenergysystems.com/">http://www.bdenergysystems.com/</a>
