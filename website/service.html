    <hr style="width:200px" class="w3-opacity">
    <p>In hichschool I was part of NHS (National Honor Society), contributing to my community through voluntary work. On one such occasion we went out into what used to be an area of houses meant for slaves and
      helped rebuild/repaint the house. We had to cover the entire house in 2 fresh coats of white paint and also fix a few parts of the house that weren't as stable as they used to be. In order to stay in NHS
      you have to volunteer for 25 hours annually. So in total I conpleted 50 hours of community service during the 2 years of highschool that I was in the NHS. You can find the link to NHS here:

    <hr style="width:200px" class="w3-opacity">
    <p>So far in college I have not had time to do any service projects or find a way to help my community. I am hoping that if this year calms down on the amount of work I have then I might be able to do the
      Big Event, which is where multiple orginizations get together and help volunteer for places around College Station. Big Event seems like the perfect way to get involved with the community around me. https://bigevent.tamu.edu/
